### Retrieving and displaying cart data on the checkout page:

- I will use SSR to fetch and display cart data to ensure the data is always fresh and up-to-date when the user lands on the checkout page. Also create  getServerSideProps handler to fetch the cart data from and API endpoint.
- The best REST API endpoint would be /api/cart that returns the current user's cart data.
And that's the implementation 

### Secure payment processing when the user submits the order:

- I will use a payment gateway like Stripe and integrate it to handle payment processing
- Create an API route in Next.js to handle payment intent creation using Stripe's server-side SDK

### Error handling in case the payment failed or something went wrong

- Implement try-catch blocks around API calls and payment processing steps  
- Display user-friendly error messages with Material UI Alert component

### Confirm the order and provide feedback to the user:

-  Upon successful payment, create an order in the database and provide feedback to the user with state variables to manage the success and error messages . I will  create an API route to handle order creation

### Summary: I provide the files with code, of course for now I used JS but in the future I would use TS but for now to create code quickly I used JS. My solution have REST API way and Context API solution. Of course we should wrap whole App with CartProvider but I don't have this component here, but I'm aware of that. The prefixes in file names are folder names where I would put certain files.
